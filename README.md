# Heap_CPP
 My implementation of a Priority Queue with a Heap in C++.

Manual: 

- add(new_element): adds new_element to the heap.

- remove(): removes and returns the first element.

- first(): returns the first element (the one with the higher priority).

- last(): returns the last element (the one with the lowest priority).

- empty(): returns true if the heap is empty.

- size(): returns the number of elements in the heap.
